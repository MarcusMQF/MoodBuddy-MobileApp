# üó∞ Moodbuddy Mobile Application Prototype

The Interactive Story Dice and MoodBuddy App is a mobile application designed to help autistic children express their emotions and build creativity through storytelling. The app's idea is to integrates with a set of physical story dice (Toys) that children can use to create unique narratives, which are then tracked and analyzed within the app.
